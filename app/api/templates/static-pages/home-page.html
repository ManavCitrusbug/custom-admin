                      </h3>
                    </div>

                    <div class="text-content-desc-inner">
                      <p class="mb-15">The philosophy of Kabbalah basically reveals how the universe and life combine to
                        work together. Kabbalah numerology analyzes an individual’s basic characteristics and inner self
                        while teaching us how to receive fulfillment in our lives. According to this system, our
                        physical universe operates according to a series of laws governed by a spiritual system.
                        <span class="block">Kabbalah numerology originated approximately 4,000 years ago and was
                          developed by Egyptian. Some people believe the system was developed much earlier by
                          Sumerians.</span>
                      </p>
                      <p class="mb-15">Kabbalah Numerology is a powerful system for discovery, a tool for seeking hidden
                        knowledge and connections in the world around us. Today, however, there are two competing
                        philosophies regarding the approach that should be taken. One system is based on birthday number
                        definitions, and the other is based on finding connections between words of equal value, through
                        Alphabetic systems. These systems are so different in their assumptions that it is almost
                        comical to call them by the same name. One is a path to discovery and the other is a balm for
                        needy psyches.</p>
                      <p class="mb-15">However, numerology in Kabbalistic sense is different from what you may think it
                        is. Kabbalah numerology is not about numbers, but rather about birth path system and alphabetic
                        name. It allows one to interpret the effects that one’s name may have on the course of future
                        events. A same birthday with a different name can tell everything different about the person it
                        belongs to: personality and temper, actions and performance, likes and dislikes, past and
                        future. </p>
                      <p class="mb-15">Many events happening in one’s life can be explained with the help of Kabbalah
                        numerology. A lonely or unsuccessful person can also use it to find a better half and a true
                        soul mate, to choose a career that matches one’s personality and needs, and take up a hobby that
                        can change one’s lifestyle. However, the best results may be achieved by combining Kabbalistic
                        ideas and numerology. Knowledge and energy of Kabbalah numerology give people the desired
                        support and provide sustainable growth in every area of their lives.</p>
